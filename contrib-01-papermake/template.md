The aim of the project is to enable the automatic insertion of numbers, figures etc. into LaTeX documents without the need for manual intervention. It can be found at https://gitlab.cern.ch/nfarley/papermake/. This is acheived by adding the following syntax to .tex files:


```latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Given $x = << value >>$, we know that $x^2 = << value**2 >>$.
\end{document}

```

Papermake uses [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) to insert values from Python (specifically using pickle files) using a custom syntax:

| syntax | what for |
|--------|----------|
| `#<` | start jinja block |
| `#>` | end jinja block |
| `<<` | start python variable |
| `>>` | end python variable |
| `#=` | start jinja comment block |
| `#=` | end jinja comment block |

(The normal Jinja2 syntax uses `{{ variable_name }}` which clashes with LaTeX's own syntax)

When this extra syntax is used in LaTeX files, Papermake reads the file, and creates a new file with the python varibles inserted into the text. If we had `value = 5`, then the LaTeX block above would become

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Given $x = 5$, we know that $x^2 = 25$.
\end{document}

```

Jinja2 also has basic loop and conditional statements, which an be found at http://jinja.pocoo.org.
