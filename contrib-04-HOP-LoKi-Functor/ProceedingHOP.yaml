abstract: As a project for the [2016 ImpactKit hackathon](https://lhcb.github.io/starterkit/archive/impactkit/2016/05/18/impactkit.html), a TupleTool and a LoKi functor implementing the HOP mass presented in [LHCb-INT-2015-037](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2102345?ln=en) have been developed and tested to reproduce the results of the study. In the case of the TupleTool, additional useful quantities related to the HOP mass, such as the $\alpha$ value, are also stored. Both tools have been merged in the appropriate packages in the lhcb software.
